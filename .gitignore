# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ignore all images for products
/public/images/products/*
!/public/images/products/.keep

# Ignore all images for the uploaded avatars
/public/images/users/avatars/*
!/public/images/users/avatars/.keep
